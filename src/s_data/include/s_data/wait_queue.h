/**
 * A wait queue is intended to be used for managing asleep threads in the kernel, but should not
 * actually need any internal thread information to work! For that reason, it is in this shared
 * module, and not in a kernel module.
 *
 * Since each wait queue implementation may abide by a slightly different interface, the parental
 * interface is pretty sparse. We really just need to be able to remove an item from any wait
 * queue using the same function signature.
 *
 * A concrete wait queue implementation should expose the following behaviors:
 *
 * 1) Enqueue an item.
 * 2) Notify, which should mark 0 or more items as ready to be dequeued.
 * 3) Pop, Which pop an item which is ready from the queue.
 *
 * These three behaviors are not included interface below since they may all require additional
 * arguments/return values.
