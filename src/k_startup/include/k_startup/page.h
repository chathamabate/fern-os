 * all page tables will be placed in arbitrary pages! (Not shared or strictly identity)
 *
 * An Identity Entry, is an entry which points to an identity page. This is a page
 * who's physical and virtual addresses are always equal. This page should NEVER be added
 * to the free list, and always placed at the correct virtual address.
 *
 * A unique entry points to a page which is only refernced by this page table. If this page table
 * is deleted, the refernced page should be returned to the page free list.
 *
 * A shared entry points to a non-identity page which is referenced by many page tables.
 * These functions offer little support for shared entries. It is the job the kernel to manage
 * such pages correctly.
 *
 * NOTE: In my pt_entry helpers below, I take a writeable bool. Since I am always running in 
 * supervisor role, this option is pointless. However, I will leave it in to remind the user
 * that certain pages shouldn't be written to.
